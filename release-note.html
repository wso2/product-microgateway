        <h2>What's new in Choreo Connect 0.9.0-Alpha</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This is the alpha release of the Choreo Connect 0.9.0</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Microservices have become the norm for modern application architecture. Workloads of modern
                    applications are<br>
                    spread across many groups of microservices, cloud services and legacy services. The characteristics
                    and<br>
                    behaviors of such heterogeneous services have a massive diversity. Such as authentication
                    mechanisms, message<br>
                    formats, high availability factors and so on. The Choreo-Connect is designed to expose heterogeneous<br>
                    microservices as APIs to end consumers using a common API interface based on the Open API
                    Specification. This<br>
                    helps expose microservices using a unified interface to external consumers, internal consumers and
                    partners. It<br>
                    applies the common quality of service attributes on API requests such as security, rate limiting and
                    analytics<br>
                    and also offers a wide range of features which helps organizations to deploy APIs microservice
                    architectures<br>
                    efficiently.</p>
